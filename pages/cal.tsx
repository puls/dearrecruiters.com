      <h1>Dear Recruiters:</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! It's your friendly local software engineer. You probably came across
        this link because you cold-emailed or cold-called me as a prospective
        candidate, and I asked you to visit this in lieu of a longer response.
      </p>
      <p>
        The talent crunch is worse than ever: the tech industry has grown by
        leaps and bounds, the FANMAGs have driven salaries sky high, and you
        have an imperative to hire infinity plus one engineers for your
        organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even those of us who are happily employed right now are aware of this
        and generally ready to hear about the next big thing, especially when
        the market is so firmly on our side.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>It's the most exciting time yet for all of us.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        But here's the rub: now we're all so busy that instead of even trying to
        engage us in a conversation or some sort of dialogue, your cold emails
        just have links to your Calendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sets up a dynamic where you're asking us to jump through hoops just
        to talk to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        One where we're just a resource to be acquired instead of a person with
        priorities, needs, and—most certainly—an ego.
      </p>
      <p>
        When all we hear from you is "please set up a time on my calendar if you
        want to discuss opportunities with my company", we feel fungible.
      </p>
      <p>Faceless.</p>
      <p>
        Wherever we are now, our company at the very least views us as an
        individual. Sending such an impersonal intro doesn't really make the
        opportunity you have for us very appealing in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Please engage us in a conversation instead of just dumping us straight
          to your calendar.
        </strong>
        &nbsp; That's all we ask.
      </p>

        Obviously, the prospective candidate you emailed didn't personally write
        this, but it's the sentiment that counts.
