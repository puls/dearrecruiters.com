<h1>Dear Recruiters:</h1>
<p>Hi! It's your friendly local software engineer. You probably came across this link because you cold-emailed or cold-called me as a prospective candidate, and I asked you to visit this in lieu of a longer response.</p>
<p>Look, we all understand how it works. Awesome companies are facing a talent crunch, and finding the most awesome software people out there is hard. Without recruiters like you, lots of great opportunities would fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>And, honestly, even though many of us are happily employed right now, it's probably true that if a really, really compelling opportunity came along, we'd probably be interested in hearing more about it and exploring our options!</p>
<p><strong>Seriously, we like you.</strong></p>
<p>But here's the rub: unless you tell us exactly what company you're working for, it doesn't come across as a really compelling opportunity.</p>
<p>Making vague references to the space doesn't help. Saying it's very successful doesn't help. Name-dropping the classiest VC firms in the world doesn't help.</p>
<p>We realize that you're doing this because it prevents us from going straight to the company and circumventing your commission. But that's really not how it comes across.</p>
<p>What comes across is that the company is so lame that only the seriously desperate need apply. And if it's a company full of desperate people, it's probably not a compelling opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Please, for the love of all that is holy, lead with the company's name.</strong> That's all we ask.</p>
